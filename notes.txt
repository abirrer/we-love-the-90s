//Notes from 13 March lecture

There is a main app component.
We're going to have a logo component, a welcome component, a main component.
In the welcome component, we will have two a login and a register component.

To render everything, we would do:
ReactDOM.render(
    <App/>, //first argument is a single component.  Cannot accept more than one.
    document.querySelector('main') //second argument is vanilla javascript that we put the component into.
);

//Tips for Debugging
    -check your import/export (default) stuff
    -check that you "return"ed your JSX

//Setting up Git
git clone [link to github]
git checkout -b annabirrer
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin annabirrer:annabirrer

//Setting up servers
node bundle-server.js (in a separate tab)
node index.js

//Props
values that are passed down to components

//State
the internal state of a class component.

//Lifecycle

componentDidMount = best place to make API calls

//Making Forms
    1. put name attribute on inputs
    2. create onChange event listener
    3. update the state in the onChange

//Part 1 Notes

----Key things to do----
-make Welcome component
-wire up onChange and onSubmit events on our form
-make Registration component
-make Logo component

-create DB
-use spicedPG
-make a POST route for our registration, utilizing axios. this happens inside the registration Form. Also need INSERT query into db
-implement logic in start.js that checks URL and renders corresponding page. (simple else if statement)
-routes in our server for /welcome and /
-for Registration, we need to use bcrypt to hashPassword and store the hash in the db (server stuff is similar to the petition project)
-make separate queries.js file
-styling

In handlesubmit, if there is an error, than render an error.
it will show up in a .catch

How the app will be structured:

Not logged in -> only allowed to see login and register pages
if logged in -> can see everything else

in start.js:
//use the location.pathname to look at urlname
//check for URL, if it is /welcome, load the welcome component
//into ReactDOM.render....otherwise, render Logo
//we will use req.session to set the logged in user, etc.

//Not logged in pages:
url is /welcome
so we need an app.get(/welcome) and send a user to this route if a user is not logged in.
render the welcome component, inside the welcome component is a registration component.
the welcome component will render the registration component.

//Logged in pages:
If they are logged in, send to the "/" route
should show us the logo component

here's now to do the logo:
function Logo() {
    return (
        <img />
    )
}

then embed it like <Logo />


two routes:

/welcome --> NOT logged in
/ -> logged in
Both of these routes serve the same res.sendFile(index.html), the only difference is the URL

so there is an if statement, that if they try to go to welcome and they are logge din,
then redirect them to /

inside of start.js, we need to check for URL and serve the different pages.

//Notes on 14 March

in welcome page we will use the hashrouter.

for the main/app page after login, then we use the browser router.

//NOTES FOR PART 3
Create a class component called App,
have a component did mount and make an axios get request to get user information.
Get id, first, last, profile pic, email

need a route for our server, similar to vue project.
The app instance should pass the information to setState.
Inside app we will have logo and profile pic and profile pic upload components.
pass the data with props to our profile pic component.

multer, aws s3, uid all set up.

set default profile picture in the this.state of the constructor

profile pic upload should display as a modal.

we will use formData to grab image from react app and save in a formdata api which can be sent to our express server.
very similar to what was done in view.

how to add things to form data: formdata.append

TO DOs:
1. Get the imge from the file input
2. Append all the data to the FormData constructor
3. axios post request, sending the formData.
4. Make a route to handle the upload.
5. Configure multer on our server.
6. Pass multer as middleware to the upload route.
7. Do the S3 dance (setting it up on AWS and in server, then successfully upload an image to our s3 bucket) which you will need to create.
8. Upon successful upload, save filename in DB along with any other information.
9. Then res.json the filename (maybe id, anything else. Optionally including the S3 base route URL).
10. setState with the new profilePicUrl.

when we upload picture, have a handleChange method

handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    let formData = new FormData();
    form.Data.append('profilepic', this.state.profilepic);

//Add axios post request, but redux alternative is:
//    this.props.dispatch(uploadImage(formData))
}

handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({
        [e.target.name]: e.target.files[0]
    }, () => {
        console.log('new state', this.state);
    })
}


WE will need to pass prop of this.toggleUploadForm

//NOTES FOR PART 4

1. Implement BrowserRouter and Route(s)
2. Make Profile component
3. Add bio column to our users table, don't forget to drop the tables.
4. Edit your routes that are getting userdata to also include the bio.
5. Add/implement edit bio part

FOR EDIT BIO:
have a button to toggle your bio text area input thing.
this comes thru the whole toggling thing we learned yesterday
It will have a button to save
After you type it in, it should be there and another edit button will appear.
There should be a setBio toggle and a bio in the state.

For the submit bio button:
- BrowserRouter is inside of the App (which allows App to render it).
- Inside of BrowserRouter is Profile
- When App mounts, it makes an axios.get request to the server, and the server will res.json the data back.
- In the client side, we setState with the data.
- Passes the component to browser via render which allows it to be passed to Profile component.
- To access props in classes, must use this.props.whatever. In functions, you only use props.whatever
- In app.post("/newBio") we access the bio via req.body.bio and update the bio just for req.session.user.id
- Then we dbquery (UPDATE)
- then req.json({success: true, newBio})
- in axios.post request do a .then((res) => { this.setState({setBio: res.data.newBio})})

//Example code for App.js:
<BrowserRouter>
    <div>
        <Link to="/">Profile</Link>
        <br />
        <Link to="/user/2">Other Profile</Link>
        <div>
            <Route
                exact
                path="/"
                render={() => (
                    <Profile
                        first={first}
                        last={last}
                        profilepic={profilepic}
                        email={email}
                        bio={bio}
                        setBio={this.setBio}
                        toggleUploader={this.toggleUploader}
                    />;
                )}
            />
            <Route exact path="/user/:userId" component={OtherProfile} />
        </div>
    </div>
</BrowserRouter>;

//19 March Notes for PART 5

To Dos:
- Make OtherProfile component
- Make route for that component, with dynamic url
- in componentDIdMount, do a GET for the other user's info using params
- Make route in express server (index.js) and do the SELECT db.query. res.json back the info
- if the user tries to view their own profile, they should be redirected
  back to / using the history.push() method.
- if your component does not rerender when clicking a link to a different user,
  you might have to use componentWillREceiveProps and compare the old state to the newProps


If user wants to attempt their own profile, check in the server app.get request
if req.session.user.id is the same as req.params.id then in the axios request,
redirect them to the ('/') profile page.  this.props.history.push('/')


//PART 6 Notes

6 States of a Friend Request:
    0. NO_REQUEST
    1. PENDING
    2. ACCEPTED
    3. REJECTED (receiver rejected request)
    4. TERMINATED (were friends and someone ended it)
    5. CANCELLED (sender cancelled request)

Tips:
- use incognito tab to log in as another user and test that the friend requests work between the two.
  incognito tab just doesn't store cookies after you leave it.


in db file for checking recipient/sender:

getFriendshipStatus = function(userId, otherUserId)
`SELECT status, sender_id AS sender, recipient_id AS recipient
FROM friendships
WHERE (recipient_id = $1 OR sender_id = $1)
AND (recipient_id = $2 OR sender_id = $2)`
[userId, otherUserId]

button only shows up in the other profile, not our own.

switch (friendshipStatus) {
    case 0:
        dispatch(sendFriendRequest(otherUserId, friendshipStatus))
        break;
    case 1:
        dispatch(sendFriendRequest(otherUserId, friendshipStatus))
        break;
    case 2:
        dispatch(sendFriendRequest(otherUserId, friendshipStatus))
        break;
}

switch (this.props.friendshipStatus) {
    case 0: //no friendship
        text = "Make Friend Request"
        break;
    case 1: //pending request
        text = "Accept Friend Request" // and need to have another button for "Cancel Friend Request"
        break;
    case 2: //accepted request
        text = "End Friendship"
        break;
    case 3: //rejected request
        text = "Make Friend Request"
        break;
    case 4:  //unfriended/terminated
        text = "Make Friend Request"
        break;
    case 5:  //withdrawn request
        text = "Make Friend Request"
        break;
    default:
        text = "Make Friend Request"
}

return (
    <button onClick={this.handleClick}> {text} </button>
)


//NOTES for PART 7

Need to make a server side route to "/friends"
and a route on the app...?

on the page will be two lists of users
By each user will be buttons to accept or end friendship.
Need an action when you first come to the tab to get this list.
You should just do one query and get back one list.


1. Actions.js
    - export action creator functions:
        - getFriendList
        - makeFriend (can use the same route /updatefriendrequest & needs to be passed id of relevant user)
        - endFriendship (can use the same route /updatefriendrequest & needs to be passed id of relevant user)
2. Reducers.js
    - export a single reducer function
        - conditionals for MAKE_FRIEND, END_FRIENDSHIP, RECEIVE_FRIENDS_LIST actions
        clone the state, and update the cloned object with the correct thing.
        for get_friends, replace current state object with new state object with an array of friends and wannabese.
        make friend and end friendship will look like make hot/not.
3. start.js
    - import your reducer, Provider, createStore, applyMiddleware, redux-promise, composeWithDevTools (check start.js in hot or not branch)
    - call createStore and pass it your reducer and passing result of call to applyMiddleware to composeWithDevTools
    - wrap App in Provider and pass your store to Provider as a prop
4. App.js
    - import default thing from Friends.js
    - add "/friends" route with default thing from friends.js as the component for it.
        (import Friends from "./friends")
        <Route path="/Friends" component={Friends}/>
5. Friends.js
    - import the three action creators
    - import connect from react-redux.
    - write a mapStateToProps function
        - set friends prop to list of users with status of 2 (filter out other statuses)
        - set pendingFriends prop to list of users with status 1 (filter out other statuses)
    - create a Friends component.
        - component expects to be passed a list of friends and list of pending friends, and dispatch function as props.
        - when component mounts, dispatch the GET_FRIENDS action, causing the list of users to be retrieved from server.
        - in render, show list of pending friends (this.props.pendingfriends) and list of friends (this.props.friends)
        - for each friend or pendingfriend, add a click handler for either accepting request or ending friendship
            - click handlers should call this.props.dispatch and pass the appropriate action.
        - there is no need to export this component.
    - export as default the result of calling: export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Friends)
6. server side stuff is normal things.


//NOTES for PART 8

Need to make a route for /online or something like that.
need to add a link somewhere to get to the page for online users.
need users first name, last name, id, photo

3 socket io events are required: triggering, emitting, handling the event.

1. when a user joins a site, that user needs to receive a list of online users to put it in the redux store.
with friends component mounts, you go get the list. call this event online users.
socket io receives an event, the data is an array of all online user info. Then dispatch an event.
Not dom events, just events from socket io.
User joined event who came online. When that event occurs, dispatch an action that passes info about user who joins.
In reducer, replace list of online users to include the new one.
Event when user leaves, user left.  When user event left, the payload (data), that person disappears.
