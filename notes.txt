//Notes from 13 March lecture

There is a main app component.
We're going to have a logo component, a welcome component, a main component.
In the welcome component, we will have two a login and a register component.

To render everything, we would do:
ReactDOM.render(
    <App/>, //first argument is a single component.  Cannot accept more than one.
    document.querySelector('main') //second argument is vanilla javascript that we put the component into.
);

git checkout -b annabirrer
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin ronan
